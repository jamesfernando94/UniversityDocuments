  abstract      = {Symbolic Model Checking [3], [14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. BDDs [2] have traditionally been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like Stålmarck’s Method [16] or the Davis & Putnam Procedure [7], can replace BDDs. This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.},

  abstract    = {The SLAM project originated in Microsoft Research in early 2000. Its goal was to automatically check that a C program correctly uses the interface to an external library. The project used and extended ideas from symbolic model checking, program analysis and theorem proving in novel ways to address this problem. The SLAM analysis engine forms the core of a new tool called Static Driver Verifier (SDV) that systematically analyzes the source code of Windows device drivers against a set of rules that define what it means for a device driver to properly interact with the Windows operating system kernel. We believe that the history of the SLAM project and SDV is an informative tale of the technology transfer of formal methods and software tools. We discuss the context in which the SLAM project took place, the first two years of research on the SLAM project, the creation of the SDV tool and its transfer to the Windows development organization. In doing so, we call out many of the basic ingredients we believe to be essential to technology transfer: the choice of a critical problem domain; standing on the shoulders of those who have come before; the establishment of relationships with "champions" in product groups; leveraging diversity in research and development experience and careful planning and honest assessment of progress towards goals.},

  abstract = {The specification of object-oriented and other pointer-based programs must be able to describe the structure of the program’s dynamically allocated data as well as some abstract view of what the code implements. The verification of such programs can be done by generating logical verification conditions from the program and its specifications and then analyzing the verification conditions by a mechanical theorem prover.

In these lecture notes, I present an object-based language, Dafny, whose specifications use the style of dynamic frames. I show how to write and specify programs in Dafny. Most of the material is devoted to how to build a first-order automatic program verifier for Dafny programs, generating the verification conditions as input to an automatic satisfiability-modulo-theories solver.},

  abstract = {Boogie is an intermediate verification language, designed to make the prescription of verification conditions natural and convenient. It serves as a common intermediate representation for static program verifiers of various source languages, and it abstracts over the interfaces to various theorem provers. Boogie can also be used as a shared input and output format for techniques like abstract interpretation and predicate abstraction. As a language, Boogie has both mathematical and imperative components. The imperative components of Boogie specify sets of execution traces, the states of which are described and constrained by the mathematical components. The language includes features like parametric polymorphism, partial orders, logical quantifications, nondeterminism, total expressions, partial statements, and flexible control flow. The Boogie language was previously known as BoogiePL. This paper is a reference manual for Boogie version 2.},
