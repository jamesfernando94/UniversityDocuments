	\section{Congestion Avoidance and Control\cite{JacobsonCongestAvoidanceControlArticle}}
	{
		This paper was the first to suggest implementing congestion control in TCP. Van Jacobson discovered that the internet was having congestion collapses. This is where throughput would drop to a fraction of what it should be this is because the network would keep dropping packets as there isn't enough bandwidth and the computers would keep resending the failed packets. Jacobson then goes on to outline the congestion control solution which would introduce many features which are still in use such as congestion windows and slow-start.

	\section{Simulation-based Comparisons of Tahoe,Reno, and SACK TCP\cite{FallFloydTahoeRenoSack}}
	{
		This paper outlines how selective acknowledgements could be used to improve the performance of TCP when a number of packets are dropped. The paper looks at how Tahoe, Reno, New-Reno and, Sack TCP handles 1,2,3 and, 4 dropped packets. The paper shows that Reno and New-Reno have problems recovering when they have a Fast Retransmit followed by a retransmit timeout and Tahoe struggles with any form of packet loss as it conducts slow-start after every packet loss. The approach of validating the use of Selective acknowledgements are show in the graphs in the paper and can be found in \cref{fig:CoparisonOfTCPWith4DroppedPackets}

	\section{CUBIC: a new TCP-friendly high-speed TCP variant\cite{HaRheeXuCubic}}
	{
		This paper proposed a novel new way of implementing BIC(Binary Increase Control) TCP using a cubic function. This provided two benefits the width of the curve could be adjusted in the cubic implementation which means that for connections with small round trip times it wouldn't follow the curve too quickly, a graph showing this can be seen in \cref{fig:BICVsCubicRTT}. Implementing the binary increase algorithm would also be quite computationally expensive where as implementing the cubic function would be relatively easy.
