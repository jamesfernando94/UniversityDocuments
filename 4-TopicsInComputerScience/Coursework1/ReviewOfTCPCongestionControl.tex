	{
		This paper was the first to suggest implementing congestion control in TCP. Van Jacobson discovered that the internet was having congestion collapses. This is where throughput would drop to a fraction of what it should be this is because the network would keep dropping packets as there isn't enough bandwidth and the computers would keep resending the failed packets. Jacobson then goes on to outline the congestion control solution which would introduce many features which are still in use such as congestion windows and slow-start.
