\section{Invoice Generator}{
	The invoice generator project is the larger project where the turn report generator came from. This project was for me to replace the current invoice generation which utilises crystal reports and implement my own invoice generation using another PDF generation tool.
	\subsubsection*{Invoice Research}{
		My first step was to conduct some research into what the invoice generation needed to support, this involved looking at some invoice templates online and some of the current crystal reports templates. This allowed me to find what features were required by the PDF generation tool e.g. Tables, UNICODE etc.
	}
	\subsubsection*{Invoice Design}{
		The designer for the invoice was to follow the same principal as the Turn report designer and would allow for the dragging and dropping of elements on the invoice page however this would be more complex as some of the elements on the page would need to be positioned absolutely on the page, for example so that addresses could be lined up with the envelope windows. Again these would need to be stored as templates. 
	}
	\subsubsection*{Invoice Generation}{
		This would need to be done using the same generator as used in the Turn report generator which is why research on the requirements for the invoice was completed before choosing the PDF generator for the Turn report generator.
