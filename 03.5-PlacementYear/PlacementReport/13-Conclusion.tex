\section{Conclusion}{
	In Conclusion, I feel that the placement year was a success for me as I learnt a lot not only about programming skills but also in other skills like time and project management skills. I feel that these will help me to be able to manage my work at University better and some of the other skills may be able to help me improve, Such as the confidence I have gained I hope this can lead me to question things I don't understand. And, I expect my programming skills will be able to improve my work. The main things I take away from the placement year is that I have now produced a few pieces of software which are actually being used commercially in addition to the various other skills I have gained.
