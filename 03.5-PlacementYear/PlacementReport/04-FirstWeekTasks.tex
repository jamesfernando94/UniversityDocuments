\section{First Weeks Task's}{
	\subsubsection*{Read Administrator Handbook}{
		This involved reading the administrator handbook whilst playing around with a copy of the billing software to get familiar with how it worked and what all the different functions are. As although you may expect that there isn't much to the billing application I can assure you its far bigger and more complicated than most would expect.

	\subsubsection*{C\# Crash Course}{
		My next task were to learn about some C\# features I heavily used \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/}{Microsoft's C\# Guide}\cite{CSProgrammingGuide2017} to learn about how to use the various features available in C\#.
