\section{Skills Gained}{
	I can comfortably say that I have gained far more skills than I expected to over the placement year. I also have found that I appear to work better in a work enviroment compared to an academic one. I feel that the ability to focus on one or two things at a time suites how my brain works a bit better than focusing on 4 modules at a time.
