\section{Turn Report Generator}{
	This was one of my main projects over the year and I spend a lot of time researching and developing the project. In the end, I didn't have enough time to complete it, however, I was able to start it and hopefully provide enough guidance and knowledge to Jonathan(The following replacement student) to finish the project. The turn report generator part of the billing application needed to be able to use a number of different templates depending on the which customer the turn report was for and what type of invoice it was. And then given this it needed to produce a PDF of the turn report. Originally the template was supposed to be created by a designer program produced by Damarel. However to cut the development time we decided that we should make and release the generator first and then make and release the designer. When we release the generator then we would also provide some templates created by hand so that the customer will still be able to use the generator.
	\subsubsection*{Template and Template Designer}{
		The Template was supposed to store information on what will be displayed in the turn report and how it would be displayed. The designer would then allow our customers to build the templates. In the research carried out for the designer I needed to work out how I would create this, it was requested that the designer should be of a what you see is what you get style, therefore I created a drag-drop system which would allow users to drag in the columns they wanted to be displayed on the report and drag to re-arrange them. This would make it as simple as possible for our customers to use. They would then have more options on the columns when they are dragged into the document. This drag-drop system was very complicated and a number of times I felt it was not possible to complete it. However, in the end, I did produce a proof of concept piece of software which was able to handle the desired drag-drop functionality, this did teach me that even if I think that something is not possible or more specifically it's not possible to do it cleanly and efficiently I need to look into other ways of completing the task at hand. I do feel that from a company viewpoint that all of the time and effort working on the drag-drop was a waste as a different implementation could have been carried out a lot quicker and that would not be much more difficult for the customers to understand. However, from a personal point of view, the learning experience is invaluable.
