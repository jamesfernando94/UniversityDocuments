\section{Turn Report Generator}{
	This was one of my main projects over the year and I spend a lot of time researching and developing the project. In the end I didn't have enough time to complete it however I was able to start it and hopefully provide enough guidance and knowledge to Jonathan(The following replacement student) to finish the project. The turn report generator part of the billing application needed to be able to use a number of different templates depending on the which customer the turn report was for and what type of invoice it was. And then given this it needed to produce a PDF of the turn report. Originally the template were supposed to be created by a designer program produced by Damarel. However to cut the development time we decided that we should make and release the generator first and then make and release the designer. When we release the generator then we would also provide some templates created by hand so that the customer will still be able to use the generator.
