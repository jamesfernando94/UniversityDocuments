	The File editor was my next project and is a console program where the initial scope for the application was to convert some configuration files from live to test values. However since then, it has become a complete file conversion application so that it is possible to set a customer and conversion type, and it will manage the conversions for those settings. It can also be developed so that it can be expanded to deal with any file type and different conversion types. As an example, it has been expanded by one of my colleagues and it is now used as a part of the build process.
