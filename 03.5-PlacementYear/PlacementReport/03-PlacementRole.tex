\section{Placement Role}{
	My Job title while working at the company was Student Placement Developer. My main purpose was to use knowledge from university to develop real projects, learn about modern technologies and real-world team working practices. My tasks are to design, develop and support software amongst other small activities which were in the company's interest. As I was assigned to the FiNDnet Billing Development team all of my work was on the Billing application or on other items to help in the development of the Billing application.
