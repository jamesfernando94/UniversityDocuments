\section{Dynamic Resource Allocation(Scheduler)}
{
	The LTE standard itself does not specify how resources are dynamically allocated this is left open so that companies who are implementing the LTE network are able to choose the best option for them. The reason it is not possible to simply use a standard scheduler algorithm is, because of the need to account for different connections that each of the UE's have, therefore a specific algorithm taking this into account must be used. I will briefly go over a few papers which demonstrate an example of a Scheduler algorithm.
