\section{LTE - Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN)}
{
    The E-UTRAN is made up of multiple eNodeB bases stations and manages the connection between the mobiles and the evolved packet core. The eNB uses the air interface to communicate with the mobile devices. It also manages the handover of the mobile devices to other eNBs\cite{tutorialspoint2018}. The E-UTRAN system it-self is made up of a number of modules which control features of the system and manage its performance most of these have been listed below.
