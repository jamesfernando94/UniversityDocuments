\section{Radio Admission Control}
{
	This deals with whether to allow a UE to access the cell. The decision on if a UE is accepted or not depends on a number of factors such as the load the cell is under, what the UE is requesting access for i.e. if is for an emergency call, and the extra load the UE is expected to add to the cell, and the number of UE's already connected to the cell \cite{RadioAdmissionControl5594566}. \Cref{fig:RACFlowchart} shows in a flowchart form what happens when a new user attempts ot join a cell.
