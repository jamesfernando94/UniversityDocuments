\section{RB(Resource Block) Control}
{
	A Resource block is \enquote{smallest radio resource unit that can be assigned to an UE for data transmission}\cite{PacketScheduling6226795}. RB Control involves managing the resource blocks and can also be called Resource Block allocation. The 4th generation system makes use of a genetic algorithm to find the most suitable block for allocation on uplink\cite{RBAlloc7577094}. On the downlink the resource block are assigned by the scheduler.
