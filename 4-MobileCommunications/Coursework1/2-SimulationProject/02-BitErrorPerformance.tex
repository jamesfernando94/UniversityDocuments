\section{Bit Error Performance}{
    \subsection{Introduction}
    {
   		This section goes through the calculation and production of Bit error rates and using them to determine a models performance.
   	}
   	\subsection{Additive White Gaussian Noise}
   	{
   		This Module adds noise to the signal using the AWGN model, it allows us to replicate real world noise in our Simulink models.
	}
	\subsection{BPSK Demodulator}
	{
		This converts the frequency data back into binary data
	}
	\subsection{Error Rate Calculation}
	{
		This compares the output to the input and calculates the changes in the signal and outputs the error statistics.
	}
	\subsection{BER Tools}
	{
		I used Matlab's build in BerTool function to create some graphs for different fading models
	}
