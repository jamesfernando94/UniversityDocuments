\section{Characteristics of Fading channels}{
	\subsection{Introduction}{
		\Cref{img:SimulinkModel} shows the model used in this section and the section goes on to describe what type of fading the model produces and how each of the blocks are used.

	\subsection{Random Input Generator}
	{
		For this I used a Bernoulli Binary Generator this block allows for the random generation of binary numbers
		\subsubsection{Parameters}
		{
			The most important parameter for this block is Sample time this allows for me to set the data rate of the connection. This is because the sample time represents how often the generator will generate a bit and if you take the inverse of that it represents the data rate. For this I set the sample time to $10^{-2}$ which implies a data rate of 100 bits per second.

	}
	\subsection{BPSK Modulator}
	{
		I used the standard binary modulator which converts the binary data from 1s and 0s to frequencies.
	}
	\subsection{Fading Channel Block}
	{
		I used a Single input single output fading channel block. This allows for me to set the parameters for the fading of the channels, giving me the tools to simulate the various fading models.
		\subsubsection{Parameters}
		{
			The parameters for this block allow me to manage the fading on each of the multipath channels, I used the Rayleigh Fading distribution channel. There is also an option for setting the Doppler effect. I set the path delays to 0 and $10^{-3}$ and set both path gains to 10.

	\subsection{Analysis of Fading model}{
		\begin{figure}

			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FrequencyResponse}

		\end{figure}
		\begin{figure}
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ImpulseResponse}
			\caption{Figure showing the impulse response of the model}
			\label{fig:ImplResponse}
		\end{figure}
		\Cref{fig:FreqResponse} and \Cref{fig:ImplResponse} show the outputs from the model. These shows that this is a flat fading model. We can prove this mathematically by showing that $B_S << B_C$ and $T_S >> \sigma_\tau$. $B_S$ is represented by the signal bandwidth which is the inverse of Sample time parameter in the binary generator. The result of this is that the signal bandwidth is 100 bits per second. $B_C$ is the coherence bandwidth this is represented by the inverse of the time between signals. As I have set one of the delay paths to 0 this means we only need to use the inverse of $10^{-3}$ to calculate the coherence bandwidth which turns out to be 1000 bits per second so this shows that $B_S << B_C$. 
		$T_S$ is represented by the symbol period as we are using a binary modulator the symbol period is the same as the bit period. This means that it is equal to the sample time set to $10^{-2}$. $\sigma_\tau$ can be found using the following equations $\sigma_\tau = \sqrt{\bar{\tau^2}-(\bar{\tau})^2}$ where $\bar{\tau} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i\tau_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i}$ and $\bar{\tau^2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i\tau^2_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_i}$ the result of these sums is that $\sigma_\tau = 5\times10^{-4}$ therefore this model satisfies the conditions to be labelled as a flat fading model

	\subsection{Conclusion}
	{
		If given more time I would have gone into looking at if this were a fast fading or slow fading model however this would not be relevant in the current model as I did not use the Doppler spread in the model.
